Person App: 
Created nodejs app that can store the data in the mongodb running locally. I was not able to retrieve the data due to time limit but the way to calculate the cost of the company would be to create a separate database with company name and keep counter for the costs that can be easily retrieved.
 
Jumble solver.
 
I was able to complete this but my find function is not 100% correct, I am able to solve the individual jumbles but just not the final one.
